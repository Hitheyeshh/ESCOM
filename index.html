          <h3>More <span>About Our History</span></h3>
          <p>Eskom is a South African electricity public utility. It was established in 1923 as the Electricity Supply Commission (ESCOM) and also known by its Afrikaans name Elektrisiteitsvoorsieningskommissie (EVKOM), by the South African government and people of the Republic of South Africa in terms of the Electricity Act (1922). South Africa became a republic in the 1960s. Eskom represents South Africa in the Southern African Power Pool. The utility is the largest producer of electricity in Africa,[2][3] and was among the top utilities in the world in terms of generation capacity and sales, but has since slipped in both categories. It is the largest of South Africa's state owned enterprises. Eskom operates a number of notable power stations, including Matimba Power Station and Medupi Power Station in Lephalale, Kusile Power Station in Witbank, Kendal Power Station, and Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in the Western Cape Province, the only nuclear power plant in Africa.</p>

          <h3>Check our <span>ACHIEVEMENT</span></h3>
          <p>A list of the achievements of the organization</p>
		  <p>The Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi Limited (ESCOM) has awarded 8 high performing female electrical engineering students from the Malawi Polytechnic with a scholarship worth MK3, 950, 000.00 to cover their tuition fees for the 2018/2019 academic year.

Speaking at the scholarship handover ceremony, ESCOM’s Director of Distribution & Customer Service, Dr. Alfred Kaponda, congratulated the girls while regretting the low participation of females in technical fields such as engineering. At ESCOM alone, out of 164 engineers 11 are females while out of 315 technicians 13 are females.</p>
<p>Speaking on behalf of the Malawi Polytechnic Engineering Department, Dean of Engineering Dr Gregory Gamula conceded that engineering is indeed a male dominated field. However, the University is striving to ensure that there is a 50:50 representation of male and female students in its education programs. He further commended ESCOM for collaborating with the University in improving female involvement in technical fields.</p>
<p>One of the female students, Tionge Nyirenda, who was receiving the award for the second year running, said that she feels empowered and equipped by the internship program which is part of the scholarship.</p>
<p>ESCOM launched the university scholarship program in 2017 to promote the involvement of female students in technical fields. To date, 14 female students from the Malawi Polytechnic and six students from Malawi University of Science & Technology (MUST) have benefited.</p>
